                                We examine the effect of policy uncertainty on the household portfolio choice using the Korea Labor Income Panel Study (KLIPS). Policy uncertainty significantly reduces the share of risky assets in the household's portfolio, as well as the probability of holding risky assets. On the top of that, we alleviate possible endogeneity problem by leveraging lottery-related questionnaire in KLIPS. Furthermore, we investigate the interaction between policy uncertainty and labor income volatility. Labor income volatility offsets the effect of policy uncertainty, which is statistically and economically significant.

                               This study examines the mixture hypothesis of conditional geometric distributions using a likelihood ratio (LR) test statistic based on that used for unconditional geometric distributions. As such, we derive the null limit distribution of the LR test statistic and examine its power performance. In addition, we examine the interrelationship between the LR test statistics used to test the geometric and exponential mixture hypotheses. We also examine the performance of the LR test statistics under various conditions and confirm the main claims of the study using Monte Carlo simulations.

                               Due to the tough Korean job market for college graduates, it has become a universal phenomenon in Korea for college students to defer graduation. In this paper, we perform a game-theoretic analysis on delayed graduation, interpreting it as a signal sent by job applicants to the firm. We show that, when the job market is tough, there can exist a separating equilibrium in which applicants with high productivity put off graduation and those with low productivity graduate on time. In addition, there can exist pooling equilibria in which applicants of both types graduate or defer graduation. We compare the payoffs of participants in the three kinds of equilibria. We also discuss how the equilibrium will change as it becomes more difficult to get a job and as the cost of deferring graduation gets lower.
