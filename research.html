                              Rising housing costs reshape who can aﬀord to become an entrepreneur. This paper examines
                                how housing aﬀordability influences entry into entrepreneurship, focusing on young individuals who
                                lack housing collateral and are more exposed to liquidity constraints as aﬀordability declines. While
                                prior studies emphasize how higher house prices can encourage entrepreneurship among homeowners
                                through collateral gains, much less is known about how worsening aﬀordability aﬀects those without
                                housing wealth. We show that examining the non-owner side is essential to understanding the broader
                                link between housing markets and entrepreneurship. We build a stylized life-cycle model in which
                                renters and homeowners are exogenously separated, and show that these groups respond to changes
                                in housing aﬀordability through opposite mechanisms: a collateral channel for owners and a liquidity
                                channel for renters. Using U.S. Census microdata aggregated to MSA-year panels and an instrumental
                                variable strategy interacting national housing demand shocks with local housing supply elasticities,
                                we find that declining aﬀordability significantly reduces self-employment among young adults. The
                                model and evidence together highlight housing aﬀordability as a fundamental determinant of who can
                                take entrepreneurial risks. Beyond housing policy, improving aﬀordability is crucial for expanding
                                economic opportunity, fostering social mobility, and sustaining local dynamism.

                               Marriage rates in Korea have been declining at an unprecedented pace in the recent
                                two decades. Drawing on the classical economic theory of marriage as a rational
                                choice, we compute local aggregate economic values of prime-age working men
                                and women to examine the relationship between the relative values of men and
                                marriage rates. The relative values of men fell dramatically by 40% during this
                                period, undermining the economic justification of marriage under unequal
                                allocation of housework. The two-way fixed-effects estimation using region-year
                                transitory variations shows that a 1% decrease in the relative values of men was
                                associated with a 0.088% decrease in marriage rates. To explain the precipitous
                                convergence of economic values between both genders, we decompose the changes
                                in the relative values into four components – (gender-neutral) structural changes,
                                (gender-specific) industrial segregation, (gender-neutral) wage growth, and
                                (gender-specific) wage gaps within industries – to measure their contributions to
                                secular marriage decline. In the 2000s, both the alleviated industrial segregation
                                and the structural changes toward industries with higher female proportions played
                                a major role. On the other hand, the impact of reduced gender wage gaps within
                                industries became also prominent in the 2010s.

                                We examine the effect of policy uncertainty on the household portfolio choice using the Korea Labor Income Panel Study (KLIPS). 
                                Policy uncertainty significantly reduces the share of risky assets in the household's portfolio, as well as the probability of holding risky assets. 
                                On the top of that, we alleviate possible endogeneity problem by leveraging lottery-related questionnaire in KLIPS. 
                                Furthermore, we investigate the interaction between policy uncertainty and labor income volatility. 
                                Labor income volatility offsets the effect of policy uncertainty, which is statistically and economically significant.

                               This study examines the mixture hypothesis of conditional geometric distributions using a likelihood ratio (LR) test statistic
                                based on that used for unconditional geometric distributions. As such, we derive the null limit distribution of the LR test statistic 
                                and examine its power performance. In addition, we examine the interrelationship between the LR test statistics 
                                used to test the geometric and exponential mixture hypotheses. We also examine the performance of the LR test statistics
                                under various conditions and confirm the main claims of the study using Monte Carlo simulations.

                               Due to the tough Korean job market for college graduates, it has become a universal phenomenon in Korea 
                                for college students to defer graduation. In this paper, we perform a game-theoretic analysis on
                                delayed graduation, interpreting it as a signal sent by job applicants to the firm. We show that, 
                                when the job market is tough, there can exist a separating equilibrium in which applicants with 
                                high productivity put off graduation and those with low productivity graduate on time. 
                                In addition, there can exist pooling equilibria in which applicants of both types graduate or defer graduation.
                                We compare the payoffs of participants in the three kinds of equilibria. We also discuss
                                how the equilibrium will change as it becomes more difficult to get a job and as the cost of deferring graduation gets lower.

                               Recently, the Korean government is promoting the joint recruitment of public institutions,
                                in which public institutions performing a similar task set a common date of written tests for entry-level employment. 
                                In this study, we analyze the effects of this policy on job seekers and institutions. Using a game-theoretic analysis, 
                                we derive the following results. First, when job seekers’ preferences for institutions are identical,
                                lower-ranked institutions are less likely to participate in joint recruitment than higher-ranked ones,
                                because joint recruitment decreases both the quantity and quality of applicants that lower-ranked institutions face. 
                                Second, when job seekers’ preferences for institutions are diverse, joint recruitment can improve the overall utility of 
                                job seekers by increasing the likelihood that job seekers enter their preferred institutions. 
                                Third, when the desirability of employment is not much different across institutions, top job seekers 
                                lose and average ones benefit from joint recruitment. Based on these results, we evaluate the policy of joint recruitment 
                                and discuss policy alternatives.

                                    This paper examines whether the labour market status of a wife increases or lowers her husband’s
                                    wage, which has not yet been comprehensively considered in the previous literature. Using Korean
                                    panel data from 1998 to 2019, we first unveil the fact that a spouse’s labour income, an indicator
                                    for labour market status, has a non-monotonic effect on the marriage premium. The premium is
                                    high for married men with non-working wives and men with working wives earning high incomes.
                                    To understand the marriage wage premium, we utilise two well-known hypotheses—specialisation
                                    hypothesis and joint-search hypothesis.
