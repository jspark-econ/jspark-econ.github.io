      My research lies at the intersection of urban, labor, and household economics, 
      with a focus on how housing affordability shapes household financial behavior and entrepreneurship; 
      how family structure, marital decisions, and economic risk influence household-level labor and financial outcomes; 
      and how household financial conditions affect labor market choices.-->
      My research focuses on how housing affordability affects household financial behavior and entrepreneurship,

      I aim to uncover causal relationships using advanced empirical methods and to understand the underlying mechanisms through structural economic modeling. 
      My work primarily draws on rich administrative and survey data from the United States and South Korea, with a growing interest in comparative analysis across East Asia, including China.
