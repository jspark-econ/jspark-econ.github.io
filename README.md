# One Simple Template to Build a Website with Github and HTML
This is a standardized HTML materials to build a personal website that looks like "doeun-kim.github.io".
I copied and modified codes from our former R maven, Tyler Reny's website/Github.
To build your own personal website with this, it requires some basic understandings of HTML. 
(Google/ChatGPT it! I also googled it.)

Here are the steps to follow:
1. Create your own Github account (your github ID will be a part of your website's address: *your_github_id*.github.io
2. Fork this repository 
3. Go to the forked repository and change the title of the repository to: *your_github_id*.github.io
4. Customize header.html, footer.html, and index.html 
  - All things you need to change are marked with brackets, [ ] 
5. In your repository, go to 'setting' > 'Pages' to set your github page as following: 
  - Source: Deploy from a branch
  - Branch: main - /(root) 
  Then, click "save"
6. Add more html pages and customize your website (Use Google and ChatGPT!)
  - I distributed an old version template to a few people. You can find a good example of personalizing the template from [Soonhong Cho](http://soonhong-cho.github.io)'s website and [his Github](https://github.com/soonhong-cho/soonhong-cho.github.io).
7. delete "README.md" file in the repository

Now go to "<your_github_id>.github.io" to check your website

It might take some time for your website to be updated after you make any changes in your repository (less than 5 minutes usually)

Note that there is a fancier way to build a website: https://jekyllrb.com
